Hello! I'm Liyuan, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Texas Tech University, delving into the fascinating realms of Explainable AI and Neuro-symbolic AI. In our world, where AI increasingly influences critical sectors like healthcare and finance, understanding the "why" behind AI decisions is crucial. Yet, as AI models grow in complexity, their inner workings often become more opaque. My research focuses on demystifying these complexities, ensuring that AI remains both powerful and understandable. I delve into how diverse data types – from text and biological sequences to images – are processed and interpreted by AI, aiming to make these systems as transparent as they are effective. 

As I look forward to a 2024 summer internship, I'm excited about opportunities to apply and expand my expertise in a dynamic, real-world environment. Your consideration and guidance would be greatly valued!
