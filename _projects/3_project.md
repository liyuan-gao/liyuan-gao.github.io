The majority of faults in steel production equipment are attributed to wear and tear. Monitoring the wear status of these machines can be effectively achieved by classifying wear debris in their lubrication systems. In this project, we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify wear debris. Additionally, we employ the Faster R-CNN model to detect the quantity and size of the wear debris. To enhance our results further, we integrate the GrabCut algorithm, which aids in refining the accuracy of our detection and classification processes.

will update soon...
